# EDA-on-Titanic-dataset
Welcome to the Titanic Data Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project! This project explores the famous Titanic dataset to uncover patterns and factors that influenced passenger survival. Through a series of analyses and visualizations, we dive deep into the data to understand how variables such as age, gender, ticket class, and family relations affected survival chances.

**Project Overview**
This project conducts a detailed exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to:

Validate assumptions and perform data cleaning.
Identify trends and outliers within the data.
Analyze the impact of demographic, socioeconomic, and relational factors on passenger survival rates.
Develop insights to improve understanding of the dataset and inform future predictive modeling.
Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about 891 passengers on the Titanic, including:

Survival status (Survived): 0 = No, 1 = Yes
Class (Pclass): Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd)
Name, Sex, and Age
Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)
Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)
Ticket and Fare
Cabin and Embarked location: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)

**Methodology**
Data Cleaning: Address missing values, standardize data formats, and ensure dataset integrity.
Feature Engineering: Extract and create relevant features (e.g., family size, title extraction from names).
Exploratory Data Analysis:
Univariate Analysis: Examine individual features (e.g., age, fare, survival rates).
Bivariate Analysis: Analyze relationships between two variables (e.g., survival rate by gender).
Multivariate Analysis: Study interactions between multiple variables (e.g., class, age, and gender combined).
Visualization: Use various plots to highlight trends and findings, focusing on survival correlations.
Key Findings
Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
Passenger Class: First-class passengers had higher survival rates than second- and third-class passengers.
Age: Children and younger passengers tended to survive at higher rates than older passengers.
Family Size: Passengers with small family sizes (1â€“3 members) had a better chance of survival.
These findings provide insight into the factors influencing survival and lay the foundation for future predictive modeling efforts.
